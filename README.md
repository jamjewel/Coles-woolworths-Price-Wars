# Coles-woolworths-Price-Wars
The main goal of the assignment was to investigate to see if there was a price difference between two superstores: Coles and Woolworths. The approach of the investigation included taking two sets of matching sample products from each of the superstores. The sample size of products was 70. We used stratified sampling approach for random sampling by dividing the products into sub-categories: Food, Vegetable, Snacks, Dairy and Raw. In each of the sub-categories, we used simple random sampling (SRS) approach to randomly select a small sample which was representative of each of the sub-categories. We performed a independent sample t-test for both of the stores. The null hypothesis was that product price was same for both stores. In short, the results of the hypothesis test are not statistically significant.
